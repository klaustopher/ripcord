# RiPCord [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klaustopher/ripcord.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klaustopher/ripcord) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ripcord.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ripcord) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/klaustopher/ripcord/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/klaustopher/ripcord?branch=master)

This is a [JSON-RPC 2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) implementation. It is heavily based on [JSONRPC::Client](https://github.com/fxposter/jsonrpc-client) but has a lot of changes
from the initial implementation that are sort of specific to our use case. But it might work for you as well.

The name *R*i*PC*ord originates from me searching for a word that contained RPC :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ripcord'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage


### Basic Usage
```ruby
client = Ripcord::Client.new('http://www.some-server.com/rpc-endpoint')

client.call('add', [1,2])
```

### ... with Authentication

```ruby
# HTTP Basic Auth (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617)
client.authentication = Ripcord::Authentication::HTTPBasicAuth.new('user', 'password')
```

```ruby
# HTTP Token Auth (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-http-token-auth-01)
client.authentication = Ripcord::Authentication::HTTPTokenAuth.new('some-token')
```

```ruby
# Inline Token
# This adds a token item to the root of the JSON request.
client.authentication = Ripcord::Authentication::InlineToken.new('some-token')
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
